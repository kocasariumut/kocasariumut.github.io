I am a master's student in the Informatics department at the Technical University of Munich. My research interests are machine learning and computer vision. In detail, I work on latent space manipulation in GANs, which could be used for various tasks such as face editing, generating the desired image, image restoration, and improving the quality of a low-resolution image.

I am very interested in the concepts of intelligence, learning, and memory. Most living beings do amazing things all the time without being aware of how complex their behaviors are. Their brains have evolved with the environment and other brains throughout millions of years. Now, we look at one of these products produced by this process, the human brain, and it is nearly impossible to understand how it works. However, trying to imitate how the brain perceives its environment via computers is one of the things we could do, and we are very good at it. Becoming a part of this process makes me very excited.

These are the reasons why my research interests are machine learning, computer vision, and artificial intelligence, in general. Up to now, I have worked on interpretations of GANs, how they learn the representations of images and how their latent spaces could be manipulated to produce the desired output.
