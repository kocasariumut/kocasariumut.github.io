## About Me

Hi, I’m Umut. 

I am a PhD student in the Visual Computing and Artificial Intelligence Lab, supervised by Prof. Matthias Nießner. 

I completed my Bachelor’s in Computer Engineering at Boğaziçi University and my Master’s in Computer Science at the Technical University of Munich. 

My previous work focused on generative modeling and latent space manipulation in GANs. 

My research interests include deep learning, computer graphics, and 3D reconstruction.

**Key Topics**: 3D Reconstruction, Generative Modeling, Geometric Deep Learning
